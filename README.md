# 📲 React Native In-App Purchase Integration

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for handling **In-App Purchases (IAP)** in a React Native application. Using this solution, you can easily integrate consumable and non-consumable purchases, subscriptions, and more into your mobile app, providing your users with an enhanced and flexible purchasing experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Consumable Purchases**: One-time purchases that can be bought multiple times (e.g., coins, power-ups).
- **Non-consumable Purchases**: One-time purchases that provide permanent content (e.g., premium upgrades, ad removal).
- **Subscriptions**: Recurring billing for ongoing services (e.g., monthly/annual subscriptions).
- **Receipt Validation**: Secure validation of purchases to prevent fraud.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly on both **iOS** and **Android** platforms.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the cross-platform app.
- **React Native IAP**: A powerful library to manage in-app purchases.
- **Firebase**: (Optional) for backend services such as analytics, receipt validation, and user management.
